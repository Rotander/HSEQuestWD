"colleagues through the Dean of the Faculty, I.V. Arzhantsev, with a proposal "
"to do a joint student project of FKN and FGRD - a quest excursion through "
"the Durasov House. The idea was great, and I started looking for FCN "
"students and the project leader who would be interested in such an unusual "
"project work. Very quickly all the participants were identified and we began "
"work. Many variants were proposed, many changes were made, many interesting "
"things were invented in the process. The result of this work for me was the "
"absolute certainty that \"combat\" projects are always more interesting than "
"educational ones. Creation of this Quest was another confirmation of this "
